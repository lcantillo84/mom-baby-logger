        <h1>Privacy Policy for Mommy's Log</h1>
        <p class="date">Last Updated: November 15, 2025</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Your Privacy Matters:</strong> Mommy's Log is designed with your privacy as the top priority. All your baby's data stays on your device - we never collect, transmit, or share any information.
        </div>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>
            Mommy's Log does <strong>NOT</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal information or data to external servers. All data you enter into the app (feeding times, diaper changes, notes, etc.) is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
            All information you log in Mommy's Log, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Feeding records (breast, bottle, formula)</li>
            <li>Diaper change logs</li>
            <li>Notes and timestamps</li>
            <li>Any other activity data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            is stored exclusively on your iPhone using Apple's secure local storage (UserDefaults). This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export it.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            We do <strong>NOT</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collect any personal information</li>
            <li>Track your usage or behavior</li>
            <li>Use analytics or tracking services</li>
            <li>Share data with third parties</li>
            <li>Sell or rent your information</li>
            <li>Use cookies or similar technologies</li>
            <li>Require account creation or login</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Export</h2>
        <p>
            Mommy's Log includes an optional export feature that allows you to copy your data to your device's clipboard in CSV or text format. You have complete control over where this exported data goes - you can paste it into email, messaging apps, or any other app of your choice. This export is entirely manual and only happens when you explicitly choose to use it.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>
            You have full control over your data. You can delete individual entries or all data at any time through the app's Settings. When you delete data from the app, it is permanently removed from your device. If you uninstall the app, all data stored by the app is automatically deleted from your device.
        </p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            While Mommy's Log is used to track information about babies and children, the app itself does not collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. All data remains on the parent's device.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
            Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data depends on your device's security measures (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID, etc.). We recommend keeping your device secure and updated with the latest iOS version.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Mommy's Log does not use any third-party services, SDKs, analytics tools, advertising networks, or cloud storage services. The app operates entirely offline and does not communicate with any external servers or services.
        </p>

        <h2>Location and Health Data</h2>
        <p>
            Mommy's Log does not access, collect, or use any device location data, health data, contacts, photos, camera, microphone, or any other sensitive device permissions beyond basic app functionality.
        </p>

        <h2>International Users</h2>
        <p>
            Since all data is stored locally on your device and never transmitted, there are no international data transfer concerns. Your data never leaves your device regardless of your location.
        </p>

        <h2>User Rights</h2>
        <p>
            As the user, you have complete control and ownership of your data. You may:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>View all data stored in the app at any time</li>
            <li>Export your data in standard formats (CSV or text)</li>
            <li>Delete any or all data at your discretion</li>
            <li>Uninstall the app, which will permanently remove all data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
            Mommy's Log is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. The developer shall not be liable for any data loss, damages, or consequences arising from the use of this app. Users are responsible for backing up their data if desired using the export feature. This app is not a substitute for professional medical advice or record-keeping required by healthcare providers.
        </p>

        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal, operational, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Your continued use of the app after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
        </p>

        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy and your use of Mommy's Log shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising from this policy or the app shall be resolved in accordance with applicable law.
